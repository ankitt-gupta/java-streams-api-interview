Stream API Question for Interview in Service based companies


// 1. Use Stream API to square each number in the list and
// collect the result into a new list.

		/* Given List: */

		List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

		/* Solution: See the project*/

        // Expected: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

// 2. Use Stream API to find the length of the longest name in the list.

		/* Given List: */

		List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eva");

		/* Solution: See the project*/

		// Expected: 7


// 3. Use Stream API to count the total number of distinct words (case-insensitive) in all the sentences.

		/* Given List: */
		List<String> sentences = Arrays.asList(
                "Java Stream API provides a fluent interface for processing sequences of elements.",
                "It supports functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as map-reduce transformations.",
                "In this exercise, you need to count the total number of words in all sentences."
        );
		/* Solution: See the project*/
		// Expected: 37

//4.  Use Stream API to find the concatenation of the first two words that have even lengths.

		/* Given List: */
		List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry");

		/* Solution: See the project*/
		// Expected: bananacherry
		
//5.  Use Stream API to find the sum of the squares of even numbers in the list.

		/* Given List: */
		List<Integer> evenNumbSquarSum = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

		/* Solution: See the project*/
